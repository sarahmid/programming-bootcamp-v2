When you use a dictionary, Python jumps directly to where the requested key *should* be, if it were in the dictionary. This is very fast (it's an O(1) operation, for those who are familiar with the terminology). With lists, on the other hand, Python will scan through the whole list until it finds the requested element (or until it reaches the end). This gets slower and slower on average as you add more elements (it's an O(n) operation). Just something to keep in mind if you start working with very large datasets!\n",
